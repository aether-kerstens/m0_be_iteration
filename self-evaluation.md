# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
I feel mostly confident with the concept as it currently is, though I am sure as it becomes far more complicated and heavy there is a chance I will become more lost.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I had a productive struggle one that I had to twist my head to better understand the angle of what we were achieving - to better see the end goal that is.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I still need to practice and learn how to end the each method without consistently printing the original array unless that is how it is meant to be - if it is not I will have to learn it through either questioning my mentors or google. I can and will be able to adjust my calendar as there is time available and time cannot be wasted in improving my skills in this category.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
Is there any limits to the each method? I am presuming its to deal with incredibly long lists of arrays most likely in the hundred yes? I will seek my answers, again, from google and my teachers.
